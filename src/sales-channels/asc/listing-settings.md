Listing settings for an Active or Inactive store are accessed from the [store's dashboard]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}).

Listing settings define how your Magento catalog products are listed on Amazon. Your listing settings consist of several categories that allow you to define the interactions and communication between Amazon Sales Channel and your respective Amazon Seller Central account.

When configuring your listing settings, you define your eligibility rules for your Magento catalog products to automatically published to Amazon as new listings, set up your Amazon listing prices based on your Magento catalog or on competitor pricing, define your fulfillment method, and more.

Settings are grouped and available in sections, to expand and configure as needed.
