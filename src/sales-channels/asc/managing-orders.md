Order information received from Amazon Seller Central shows in the _Recent Orders_ section of the [store dashboard]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}).

Regardless of your [order import settings]({% link sales-channels/asc/order-settings.md %}), Amazon orders that existed in your Amazon Seller Central account prior to your [store integration]({% link sales-channels/asc/store-integration.md %}) will not import into Magento.

## With Order Import Disabled

After [store integration]({% link sales-channels/asc/store-integration.md %}), [**Import Amazon Orders**]({% link sales-channels/asc/order-settings.md %}#configure-order-settings) is `Disabled` by default. This means that your Amazon order information will show on the store dashboard, but your Amazon orders are not imported and cannot be managed in Magento.

If your [order import settings]({% link sales-channels/asc/order-settings.md %}) are set to `Disabled`, order information received from Amazon appears in the _Recent Orders_ section of the store dashboard. Order information is view only, and managing these orders must be done in Amazon Seller Central.

_Recent Orders - Not Imported_

## With Order Import Enabled

If you want to import and manage your your Amazon orders in Magento, you can change the [**Import Amazon Orders**]({% link sales-channels/asc/order-settings.md %}#configure-order-settings) setting to `Enabled`. This means that when new orders are received from Amazon, corresponding Magento orders are created, based on Amazon status and stock levels.

All new orders created in Amazon will import into Magento, but not immediately. Amazon assigns a `Pending` status to newly created orders. After Amazon verifies the order and payment method, the order status is changed to `Unshipped`. This status change by Amazon triggers the order import, and Magento creates a matching, corresponding order.

An Amazon order is added to the to the _Recent Orders_ section of the store dashboard when Amazon changes the order status from `Pending` to `Unshipped`. Remember, information sync depends on your cron settings and the time it takes Amazon to process information.

_Recent Orders - Imported_

You will manage your imported Amazon orders in the [Magento Orders]({% link sales/orders.md %}) process and workflow, just like your other Magento stores and sales. When viewing your recent orders on the store dashboard, you click the Magento order number to open the order in the [Magento order process]({% link sales/order-processing.md %}#order-view-descriptions).
