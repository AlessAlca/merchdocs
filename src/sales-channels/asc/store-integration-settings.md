After integrating your store, review and configure the integration settings store through the Amazon Store Dashboard. These settings display for **Inactive** and **Active** stores. Stores with the **In Setup** status can be configured through the [Onboarding steps]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-onboarding-home.md %}).

## Modify store integration settings

1. Click a store name in the _Amazon Stores_ tab on the Amazon Sales Channel home page to display the store's dashboard.

1. On the [store's dashboard]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}), under the _I Want To..._ header, click **Store Integration Settings**.

1. For **Email Address**, update your preferred contact email address.

1. For **New Store Name**, update the descriptive name for your new Amazon Sales Channel store. This name appears on the [_Amazon Stores_]({% link sales-channels/asc/managing-stores.md %}) tab.

    This name is used as a Magento reference only and will identify the store in the list on the Amazon Sales Channel home page. You will want to make it something your team can easily identify. For example, your Amazon store that sells in the United States region might be named `Amazon Store USA`.

1. The _Amazon Marketplace_ setting cannot be updated.
