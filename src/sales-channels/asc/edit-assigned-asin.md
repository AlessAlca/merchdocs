title: Edit an Assigned ASIN
---

You can edit the Amazon ASIN value assigned to a product in your Magento catalog. This is a helpful feature if a catalog product was improperly matched to one of your Amazon listings. Changing the assigned ASIN for the listing does not change the ASIN assigned to a product by Amazon. It only changes the Amazon listing to which your catalog product is matched.

When an assigned ASIN is changed, Magento ends your Amazon listings attached to the old ASIN, validates the ASIN with Amazon, creates a new listing for the updated ASIN, and updates listing information in Amazon Sales Channel.

## Edit an assigned ASIN

1. View the listing in one of the Product Listing pages (Inactive, Active, or Ineligible).

1. Under _Action_, click **Edit Assigned ASIN** to open the _Product Listing Update_ page.

1. Enter the new ASIN value for **Assign ASIN**.

1. Click <span class="btn">Save Listing Update</span> to save your changes.
